The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage,
- Keep the old webpage, or
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
  
#### File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook that contains the code in this project. In the notebook , We will perform Hypothesis tests using the following methods:
- Probability
- A/B Test
- Regression
