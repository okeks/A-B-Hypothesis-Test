### Analyze AB TEST Project 

For this project we will like to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage,
- Keep the old webpage, or
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

 We will perform Hypothesis tests using the following methods:
- Probability
- A/B Test
- Regression
